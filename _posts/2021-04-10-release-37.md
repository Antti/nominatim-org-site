title: "Nominatim 3.7.0 released"

This week we have released version 3.7.0 of Nominatim. The two biggest changes
of this release have already been introduced in previous blog posts:
the new [nominatim tool](https://nominatim.org/2021/02/25/nominatim-tool.html)  and the
change in [how Nominatim is installed](https://nominatim.org/2021/03/08/of-installation-and-updating.html).
To make transition and updating easier for you, 3.7.0 is a transitional release
that still supports the old way of installing and running the admin tools. The
old PHP scripts will be removed in the next release.

With this release we have also switched to a new format for the configuration
file. Nominatim now uses [dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv)
for custom configuration. As a user you now have the choice to store your
configuration in the `.env` file in your project directory or simply set
environment variables. This gives you more flexibility. For example, when you
want to catch up once on a larger chunk of updates, you can do this quickly
on the command line without having to change your settings:

```
NOMINATIM_REPLICATION_MAX_DIFF=3000 nominatim replication --once
```

This will fetch 3GB of updates instead of the usual 50MB.

For more information about how to update to the newest version, have a look
at the [Migration guide](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/admin/Migration/) in the documentation.
