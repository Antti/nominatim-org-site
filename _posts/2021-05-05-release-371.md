There is now a bug fix release 3.7.1 of Nominatim available.

This release fixes some compatibility issues with older versions of Python which
meant that Nominatim could not be used on Ubuntu 18.04. With the new release
the code now works with all Python versions >= 3.5 as described in the
documentation.

The release also fixes an issue with index naming which prevented one of the
indexes on the TIGER tables to be created. If you already have installed a new
database using the 3.7.0 release, you need to add this index manually:

```
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_location_property_tiger_place_id  ON location_property_tiger_import (place_id);
```

If you plan to do a new installation of Nominatim, you should make sure to
switch to the new version. Existing installations can skip this release.
